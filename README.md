# Space-AI

This is just a little project I have started. Mostly using various A.I with the code. I have also learning python as the debugging is HUGE when working with A.I. I'm wondering at what point I wont need A.I to write scripts, but just use A.I to help me debug.


I will update this as I develop it firther. 

Am also very aware It's broken right now haha.
