# Space-AI

This is just a little project I have started. Mostly using various A.I with the code. I have also began learning python as the debugging is HUGE when working with A.I. I'm wondering at what point I wont need A.I to write scripts, but just use A.I to help me debug.


I will update this as I develop it firther. 

Am also very aware It's broken right now haha.


but i asked an A.I what it's all about and this is what is said:

This project demonstrates how NLP and database technologies can be used to create a language learning tool that is both informative and engaging. The project has the potential to be a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about language.
